    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Language Model (LLM) serving at scale refers to the process of delivering an LLM as a service to a large number of users efficiently. This involves setting up a robust and efficient infrastructure to handle a large number of requests quickly and at a low latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM inference at scale can be achieved through various techniques such as model parallelism, data parallelism, efficient data handling, optimized inference, asynchronous inference, auto-scaling, load balancing, optimized hardware, caching, and using model serving frameworks. The goal is to minimize the latency of individual requests, reduce the computational complexity of the model, and improve the overall system throughput to meet the demands of a larger number of users. \n",
    "\n",
    "By serving an LLM at scale, you can make it accessible to a wider audience and enable them to use the model to generate text, translate languages, answer questions, and perform other natural language processing tasks quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I will use Amazon SageMaker to show how we can control resources to serve our LLM models at scale. It may include the number of GPUs, memory, or the replicas assigned to serve dynamic amounts of requests to our LLM models. Moreover, I also show how to attach an auto-scaling policy to our serving endpoint which will scale our endpoint automatically when workload varies. "

    "## AWS Deep Learning Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a forefront of innovation in artificial intelligence, capturing the attention of academic establishments, tech companies and enthusiasts with their sophisticated capabilities. Models built on architectures like GPT and Llama have rapidly gained traction for a wide range of uses such as language comprehension, conversational interfaces, and automated content creation. This surge in demand has led many companies to explore and integrate LLM-driven features into their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, deploying LLMs on a large scale involves complex engineering challenges. To ensure a seamless user experience, hosting services for LLMs need to maintain quick response times while supporting numerous users simultaneously. Due to the substantial resource demands of these models, standard inference frameworks often fall short in delivering the necessary optimizations for optimal resource use and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key optimizations that can enhance LLM hosting include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tensor parallelism, which spreads computation across multiple processing units.\n",
    "* Model quantization, which reduces the model’s memory usage.\n",
    "* Dynamic batching of requests to increase processing throughput and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, AWS has released a new Hugging Face Deep Learning Container (DLC) for inference with Large Language Models (LLMs). This new Hugging Face LLM DLC is powered by Text Generation Inference (TGI), an open source, purpose-built solution for deploying and serving Large Language Models. TGI enables high-performance text generation using Tensor Parallelism and dynamic batching for the most popular open-source LLMs. The Hugging Face LLM DLC incorporates all the aforementioned optimizations as standard features, simplifying the large-scale deployment of LLMs."

    "# Multi-model deployment on SageMaker\n",
    "Multi-model endpoints offer a scalable and cost-effective way to deploy models. Multi-model endpoints use a single set of resources and a shared serving container to host all the models together. This shared setup allows the models to efficiently use the same hardware, which helps lower hosting costs. By improving endpoint's resources usage, multi-model endpoints are more cost-effective than deploying each model on its own separate endpoint. Figure 1 comapres single-model endpoint and multi-model endpoint. You can use Amazon SageMaker to deploy one or more models to an endpoint. If you deploy multiple models to the same endpoint, they will share the resources available there, including ML compute instances, CPUs, and accelerators. This means that all the models will use the same hardware resources for their computations. The most flexible way to deploy multiple models to an endpoint is to define each model as an <i>inference component</i>. \n",

But, what are the right values in this configuration? Since we defined 8 replicas, we need to divide our resource by 8. That is 1 GPU per replica. However, SageMaker sets aside some CPU and memory resources for task management. More precisely, It reserves 2 units for this purpose. For example, ml.g5.48xlarge instance has 192 CPUs. 192/8 = 24. Therefore, we will have: $(192- (2*24))/8 = 18$ CPUs and $(768- (2*768/8))/8 = 72 KB$ memory for each replica. "

    "With the target tracking scaling policy, you choose an Amazon CloudWatch metric and target value, such as SageMaker VariantInvocationsPerInstance = 100, and SageMaker can keep VariantInvocationsPerInstance at, or close to 100. This approach is very common due to its ease of configuration.\n",

    "The simple scaling policy triggers a scaling event based on a specified metric at a defined threshold with a fixed amount of scaling. For instance, \"when SageMaker VariantInvocationsPerInstance > 1000, add 10 instances.\" This strategy requires more configuration but offers greater control compared to target tracking.\n",

    "* Step Scaling:\n",
    "You can use step scaling when you require an advanced configuration, such as specifying how many instances to deploy under what conditions. For example, \"when SageMaker VariantInvocationsPerInstance > 1000, add 10 instances; when SageMaker VariantInvocationsPerInstance > 2000, add 50 instances.\" This approach demands the most configuration but provides the highest level of control, especially for handling spiky traffic."
